# WatchAlerter

WIP.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Issue with an upgraded version?

1. Revert individual entries in `requirements.txt` with the help of git
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to downgrade to working versions
3. Commit the upgraded-and-tweaked `requirements.txt` like normal and carry on ðŸŽ‰

### Installing

`config.py` contents:

```
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
user_agent = "YOUR_USER_AGENT"s

reddit_un = "YOUR_REDDIT_UN"
reddit_pw = "YOUR_REDDIT_PW"
```
